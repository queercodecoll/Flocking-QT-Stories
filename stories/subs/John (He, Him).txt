John
(He, Him)
0000:I was raised in a household that defined cutting the grass as work for me and my older brother,
0006:while doing laundry was a job for my younger sister.
0008:I often would question my parents on why?!
0011:and could never accept the answer that it was because she was a girl.
0015:Without an acceptable answer, and punishment for not performing my masculine duties,
0019:the house was not a place for me to explore gender.
0023:Outside of the house, my brother's friends, and even my own peers
0026:would mock any action that wasn't deemed masculine.
0029:Thus, out of fear of ridicule, this was not an environment either for gender exploration.
0035:It wasn't until elementary school that I learned that, through comedy, I could explore gender.
0041:I realized that I could wear a dress and makeup, even fall into a higher pitched voice
0046:all without social repercussions, as long as it was for the sake of entertainment,
0051:specifically making people laugh. Or, so I thought.
0056:After the first time, another chance would eventually come.
0059:But, rather than deciding myself, it was decided for me that I would dress up.
0064:I was now labelled as someone who would cross-gender play for the sake of a laugh.
0069:It didn't stop after elementary school. It didn't stop after middle school.
0073:The memory of me in a dress carried with my peers, and every chance I would be voluntold
0078:to don a wig, a dress, and a higher pitched voice.
0082:It was around this time that I realized that I wasn't exploring gender on my terms.
0086:Instead, I was just appeasing the masses because of how I was labelled.
0090:And by doing so, I was making a mockery of gender play.
0093:While in university, I came to start performing burlesque
0097:as a way to learn what it means to be masculine.
0100:However, what I also learned, was a way to explore gender beyond masculinity,
0105:but in a way that I could be proud of
0108:and with an audience that could appreciate gender expression.
