0000:I was already working for, maybe, half a year
0005:and one of my colleague for a permanent installation came to me.
0011:He really needed to start a work in the other side of Paris,
017:where, like, an hour to an hour and a half to drive.
0022:He needed to take his car, but he also needed a truck to come
026:to bring all the stuff, and
0028:I've never drive a truck before. It was just like,
0031:"Have you ever done that?" I was just like, "No" and
0033:he was, "Well, anyway, I really need you to drive this truck because
0037:I need to take my car. I'm living nearby this place.
0041:So, you will have to take this truck and come to me and we'll start the work together."
0048:And I took this truck, and there was a really, like,
0052:okay that's the first time you do this thing. You're just doing it.
0057:You're going to go slowly. I mean, everyone learn that once.
0062:And that was a funny experience because
0065:I realized that through all these months before, like
0068:the internship that came after me were driving the truck way before me,
0074:and no one ever tried to ask me to drive this truck before and they were just um..
0083:there was many little things that feels more implicitly impossible for me to do um.. since..
0093:until I've done it, and it was easy and no matter I was, like, a girl or a boy,
0100:I could just do it and I think that's the main point of like a neutral gender education
0108:or a neutral gender awareness because
0113:everyone can do whatever they want as long as they just like what they're doing
0119:and they're just motivated for that.
