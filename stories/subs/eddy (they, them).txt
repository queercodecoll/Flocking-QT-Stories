0000:So I remember specifically about 6 months after I had started to really socially
0007:come out as using they/them pronouns and with a different name.
0011:I went to Ontario to visit my family.
0014:and I, after like a trip through airport security and after dinners out and
0023:spending time with all my family members,
0026:I had been "ma'am"ed and "lady"ed and "she"d so many times.
0031:It was just getting...
0033:I wasn't surrounded by my.. my queer family and so it was getting really overwhelming.
0038:And I remember one time I just decided to go for a walk down to the river.
0043:And I must have sat in front of the river for like half an hour,
0046:just thinking about how impossible I thought the
0050:future would be to navigate using they/them pronouns
0054:and realizing that I never maybe would see a future where that was normalized and
0060:that was really scary and I was frozen with the realization
0065:and I just remember I was shooken out of it
0068:because my friend called to check in on me and ask
0071:how I was doing. And they just said my name
0074:over and over and over and over and over again.
077:and they told me that it was because I was surrounded by family and I had no queer family
0083:that I'd.. I'd lost a few.. I'd lost a little bit of my hope,
0088:but that it would come back when I came back to Calgary and it gave me comfort.
0093:And it is, of course, still hard. But, for that moment it helped me see hope again.
