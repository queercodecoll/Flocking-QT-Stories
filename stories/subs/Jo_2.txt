0000:I was setting up a PA in a city in South of France.
0008:We were the manager team and the sound tech team .
0013:And there were a really big team of loaders and people helping us around.
0018:It was a really big installation.
0021:I was installing the left side with my colleague that really helped me in this industry and
0030:a guy just randomly came and put this.. put his hand on my hips and just
0036:tell me something like, "Hey, sweetheart, let me hold on to that for you. You're not strong enough."
0044:I was already working for a year and this was just one of the other example that I had
0051:all along the year. Kind of, you're working, there is.. you're almost the only girl,
0057:or the only girl, and people are just going to try to, like, step in front of you
0063:and do the job because they think you're not competent for that.
