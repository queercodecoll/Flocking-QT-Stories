0000:I grew up in a pretty supportive family.
0004:We uh.. We had lots of queer people around.
0007:I had queer godparents. I had, uh, a drumming instructor that was queer.
0014:And, uh, it was still really difficult to, um, find a way to come out and be myself,
0023:you know, in junior high and high school.
0026:I had a lot of, um, lots of great friends who really cared about me and
0029:treated me extremely well.
0032:The thing that was a big struggle was I had no.. I had no peers to relate to.
0037:I had no role models that were my own age. They were all, you know, in there 40s or 50s and
0045:It was really difficult to imagine what my life would be like if I came out.
0050:It would be.. you know.. It seemed like there was no one to date.
0053:There was no groups to go to. There was really just nowhere to belong.
0060:And so even though I grew up very supported, it took a long time for me to come out
0068:until I moved to a bigger city and actually met other queer people my own age.
0073:So, community. It's important. Community your own age makes a really big difference.
