0000:Almost as long as I remember, I’ve had the feeling that my body betrayed me.
0006:It was like travelling with a medieval fanfare that marched ahead of me,
0010:distorting how others saw me and how they interpreted what I did or what I had to say.
0015:At Disney world when I was six, I insisted that my parents buy me a Mickey Mouse hat
0021:and not a Minnie Mouse one,
0023:because the idea of wearing a bow seemed absurd to me and
0027:Mickey was a way better character anyway.
0030:But nothing could have prepared me for the feeling of pride, relief and joy
0035:when someone later casually asked my mom how old her little boy was.
0039:It was a fairly inconsequential interaction
0042:that on another day maybe I wouldn’t have even noticed,
0046:something that’s probably happened to many kids at some point or another
0049:and didn’t make much of an impression.
0052:But the feeling never left me.
0054:It was like being transformed by Cinderella’s godmother
0057:and magically given access to a world that was usually off limits,
0061:to a way of being that I wasn’t allowed to have.
0064:And it was something that I don’t remember feeling again until I did my first radio interview.
0070:Those two experiences don’t seem like they should be connected.
0075:Me, as a short-haired six-year-old
0077:in a scratchy polyester striped t-shirt and Mickey Mouse ears
0082:and me as a 30 year old sitting on the floor in my kitchen,
0085:holding a cordless phone and talking to a student radio host
0088:thousands of kilometers away.
0091:But again I couldn’t ignore how it felt.
0094:As I talked on the phone, for the live radio interview,
0097:my body melted away and I was just me:
0101:the ideas I had and the words I wanted to say.
0106:I thought of and felt nothing else,
0109:no constant gaze questioning my female body,
0112:no constant doubt from others that I was either doing science wrong or femaleness wrong.
0119:I was just the person I always wanted to be.
0122:This probably isn’t the reason that most people get into doing radio and podcasting
0127:but, for me, it was a way of interacting with people
0130:that gave me something I’d never found anywhere else.
