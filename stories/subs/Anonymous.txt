0000:It was about two months ago, I received a beautiful peach-coloured scarf as a present.
0008:I immediately thought that I'm not feminine enough to wear it.
0013:I usually wear black and different shades of grey.
0018:I guess these choices started as an effort to hide a few extra pounds accumulated over months
0024:and also trying to be taken seriously and get some respect at my workplace.
0031:Bright colours like electric blue, lime green, or fuchsia were never treated as serious, right?
0039:As my closet became darker and darker, I felt less feminine.
0044:I think that society's norms for the match up of colours and genders
0048:were penetrated deeper into my consciousness than my expectations.
0054:Still today, all around the world, blue is for baby boys, and pink is for baby girls.
0061:We are being raised with those commitments.
0064:I can't stop but wonder how a colour deficient world
0068:would affect our perception of gender and sexual identities.
