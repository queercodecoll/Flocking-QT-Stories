(He, Him)
0000:As an academic, I grew up in a culture of physics that was fiercely masculine.
0007:Doubting that masculinity was not an option and mostly I was unaware of it.
0015:Every conversation could be an argument and the best argument would win.
0020:And although the joys of winning or losing the argument are intensely personal,
0025:people would remain mostly hidden in the arguments.
0031:People, I was told, were less important than ideas.
0036:Ideas transcend people.
0039:It is still a painful reality to me, as an academic,
0042:that people remain hidden in the academy.
0045:The veil of masculinity hides queer and trans folks,
0049:people of colour, women, and potentially, everyone.
0054:I see this as a paradox.
0056:Academics love ideas
0058:and ideas can, indeed, be beautiful experiences.
0061:But what good are ideas if people cannot experience them.
0065:And I mean all people. Not just the few heteronormative,
0069:privileged, cis men academics.
0072:So here is what I think. The fear of people in the academy
0077:is also a fear of ideas that are different than the norm.
0081:But, as academics and as members of the public,
0085:it is in our own interest for this to change
0089:because whenever we have opened up the academy to new ideas,
0093:new people have come in.
0095:and whenever we have opened up the academy to new people,
0098:new ideas have come in.
0099:In this way, the academy can begin to look more like the world we live in
0104:with our differences.
