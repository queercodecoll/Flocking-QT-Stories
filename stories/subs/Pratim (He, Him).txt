(He, Him)
0000:As an academic, I grew up in a culture of physics that was fiercely masculine.
0007:Doubting that masculinity was not an option and mostly I was unaware of it.
0015:Every conversation could be an argument and the best argument would win.
0020:And although the joys of winning or losing the argument are intensely personal,
0026:people would remain mostly hidden in the arguments.
0031:People, I was told, were less important than ideas.
0036:Ideas transcend people.
0039:It is still a painful reality to me, as an academic, that people remain hidden in the academy.
0045:The veil of masculinity hides queer and trans folks, people of colour, women, and potentially, everyone.
0054:I see this as a paradox. Academics love ideas and ideas can, indeed, be beautiful experiences.
0061:But what good are ideas if people cannot experience them.
0065:And I mean all people. Not just the few heteronormative, privileged, cis men academics.
0072:So here is what I think. The fear of people in the academy is also a fear of ideas that are different than the norm.
0081:But, as academics and as members of the public, it is in our own interest for this to change
0089:because whenever we have opened up the academy to new ideas, new people have come in.
0095:and whenever we have opened up the academy to new people, new ideas have come in.
0099:In this way, the academy can begin to look more like the world we live in with our differences.
