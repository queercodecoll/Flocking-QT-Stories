- Story 1
0000:I was in this room for my first ever interview to be a sound tech and
0009:and to start in this industry and they asked me
0013:why they.. why I could think they would be interested about my profile,
0019:which was a totally beginner, and
0021:I explained that I was doing a lot of festivals as a volunteer and
0026:I was trying to find my way into sound for a long time,
0032:but that now I needed to have the step to the professional world.
0038:And they just answered me, telling me that they were interested because I was a girl,
0045:and just because there were no girl in the warehouse yet, so they wanted to give a try.
0053:And that was maybe giving the tone of the rest of the years for my apprenticeship in the sound,
0061:where I was more trying to fight for my gender and for my ability more than for what I needed to learn instead.
