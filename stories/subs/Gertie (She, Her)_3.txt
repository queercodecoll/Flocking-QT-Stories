Gertie - Story 3
(She, Her)
0000:I don't often tell people that I'm bisexual.
0003:It doesn't feel safe for me.
0005:In different spaces, I listen and then I try and advocate as if I were an ally.
0011:That feels much safer.
0013:In progressive circles, I will hear people give stereotypes about bisexual people
0018:being cheaters, or not really being bi.
0020:For example, "Bi women, really, are out to attract men." Whereas, "Bi men are really gay."
0025:And I feel like, as an ally, they can hear me more.
0028:And it still hurts when I hear, um, women that I admire, lesbians that I really look up to,
0035:talk about how they would never date a bisexual woman.
0038:And they don't even know they're talking to one.
0042:In religious circles, I also, find myself advocating for the queer community
0048:and telling people.. like, correcting stereotypes.
0052:And, again, I'm assumed to be straight and this is what lets me get into their circles at all.
0059:And, at the end, sometimes I'll be told,
0062:"I'll pray for you. I'll pray for you while you witness to those queer people,
0067:so that God can help you convert them. I will be remembering you because it must be so hard."
0073:And in the meantime, I'm queer. They're talking about me.
0078:I'm the enemy that they think they have. So I stay silent.
