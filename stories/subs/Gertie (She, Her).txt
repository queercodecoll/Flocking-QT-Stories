Gertie
(She, Her) - Story 1
0000:I grew up in a very religious family and community.
0006:And I grew up hearing all sorts of toxic stereotypes about women.
0013:It was very heteronormative and very patriarchal.
0016:And I grew up hearing preached from men that
0019:women's bodies, or people assumed to be women,
0022:were inherently sexual, which was inherently dirty.
0027:And so, as I got older, and I realized that, yes,
0031:of course, I found women and people who were identified as women,
0038:when I found them attractive, I thought this was.. this was of course normal
0042:because that's how those types of bodies are.
0046:So I did not realize that I was bisexual because
0048:I thought this was a universal experience that everyone had.
0052:And, I remember hearing a lot from people in my church that,
0058:"Homosexuality was a choice."
0061:which further reinforced that everyone, of course,
0063:could find people of any gender attractive
0067:and that the sin was in choosing to act on it
069:and some people were more tempted than others.
0072:And I remember hearing from my mother
0074:that she would thank God that she was never tempted like that.
0079:And so, of course, when I hit puberty and all of a sudden noticed
0084:and had thoughts fly into my head,
086:"Oh, I wonder what her lips would taste like."
0089:I was horrified because, of course, this was the Devil tempting me. This was demonic.
0093:I had to shut this down.
095:So I was very good at shutting it down for a long time.
0100:And this was further reinforced that I couldn't feel any sort of sexuality
0104:because sexual urges were lust, which was sin.
0108:And especially lust towards people of the same gender
0112:or assumed to be the same gender as I was.
