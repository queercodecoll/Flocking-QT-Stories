Gertie
(She, Her) - Story 2
0000:When I was seventeen, I went to a weekend retreat with my youth group
0006:to an organization that promoted conversion therapy
0011:and it's whole reason for being was to, a.. persuade people from being homosexual.
0018:So they targeted teenagers with the thought of being preventative.
0022:And the workshop that I remember the most
0026:I believe was called, "The Dark Side of Being Superglued."
0030:And the woman who shared her story talked about falling in love with her best friend,
0034:and framed the acts of love and intimacy
0040:and those feelings as deep sin and tarnishing her forever,
0044:and talked about her long struggle to break free
0048:from this love and find a heterosexual marriage.
0053:What I took away from that was not only that intimacy and emotional intimacy
0061:and sexual intimacy between two women was a deep sin against one's own self,
0067:one's own soul and spirit, and against God, and against the community,
0070:but that deep friendships between women were
0072:something to be feared and something dangerous.
