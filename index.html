          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Watch the simulation to see how non-normative (pink) boids are affected by crossing paths with normative (white) boids and institutions and non-normative boids and institutions.</li>
            <li>Turn on/off the ‘Show Interactions’ button to show effects of harm (red lines) and support (turquoise lines).</li>
            <li>Click on a non-normative (pink) boid to hear a real-life story about gender or sexuality-based marginalization and resilience.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p lang="en-us">Flocking QT Stories models the <em>emergent behaviour</em> of societal gender and sexuality-based marginalization (harm) and resilience (support).
          Emergent behaviors are new behaviors (or patterns in a simulation) that are not planned but rather arise from a simple set of rules. What can you see as the kinds of
          emergent behaviours arising from the simple interactions of harm and support that non-normative (pink) boids experience? What impact do many small harmful
          interactions have over time? What does harm and support from people and instititutions look like for people of <em>all</em> genders and sexualities?</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p lang="en-us">The stories in the simulation have been collected from people with various gender and sexual identities, including cisgender and transgender, and queer (LGBQ+) and heterosexual people.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="longText">
          <h3>Rules of the Simulation</h3>
          <p lang="en-us">In the simulation, there are four types of computational agents: normative and non-normative <i>boids</i> or bird-droids (a term coined by Craig Reynolds),
          and two types of <i>institutions</i>: normative and non-normative. Proximity to normative boids and institutions "drains" energy from the non-normative boids,
          and proximity to other non-normative boids and institutions increases their energy. Each non-normative boid "carries" and audio story - a first person account
          of gender and/or sexuality-based marginalization and resilience.
          <p><br /></p>
          All of the boids move according to Craig Reynolds' (1987) flocking algorithm. In Reynolds' algorithm, the rules obeyed by each boid are
          alignment, separation, and cohesion. Alignment means that a boid tends to turn so that it is moving in the same direction that nearby boids are moving.
          Separation means that a boid will turn to avoid another boid which gets too close. Cohesion means that a boid will move towards other nearby boids (unless
          another boid is too close).
          <p><br /></p>
          In addition to these forces that are always in play, when a non-normative boid's story is activated, all the non-normative boids' movements
          are also affected in part by the frequences of the audio file which is broadcasted to all non-normative boids in the simulation. Higher-frequency sounds affect
          the cohesive motion, lower-frequency sounds affect the separation, and medium-frequency sounds align their directions with neighbouring boids. The overall
          effect is that the movement pattern of the non-normative boids is visually distinct from the normative boids while a story is being played.
          The non-normative boids vibrate synchronously while also flocking.</p>

          <h3>Description and History</h3>
          <p lang="en-us">
            Flocking QT Stories, is an interactive digital art installation that explores how computational simulations of emergent complex behaviours, combined with storytelling,
            might provide us with new ways to deepen our understanding of gender and sexuality-based marginalization and resilience through computer modeling and art.
          <p><br /></p>
            Flocking QT Stories is part of Dylan Paré’s dissertation in the Learning Sciences in the Werklund School of Education at the University of Calgary, Canada.
            The simulation was initially developed during the <a href="https://www.m3lab.org" target="_blank">Mind, Matter and Media Lab</a>’s Paul D. Fleck artist residency in the Leighton Studios at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity in April 2019 using
            Processing 3.5.4. Then in May 2020, it was re-written in p5.js 1.0.0 for display on the internet using GitHub and GitHub Pages in order to share the simulation
            with a larger audience. The simulation has exhibited at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, TELUS Spark Science Centre, and at DigiPlay, a public exhibit
            space at the University of Calgary Werklund School of Education.
