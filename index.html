          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Watch the simulation to see how non-normative (pink) boids are affected by crossing paths with normative (white) boids and institutions and non-normative boids and institutions.</li>
            <li>Turn on/off the ‘Show Interactions’ button to show effects of harm (red lines) and support (turquoise lines).</li>
            <li>Click on a non-normative (pink) boid to hear a real-life story about gender or sexuality-based marginalization and resilience.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><br /></p>
        <p lang="en-us">Flocking QT Stories models the <em>emergent behaviour</em> of societal gender and sexuality-based marginalization (harm) and resilience (support).
          Emergent behaviors are new behaviors (or patterns in a simulation) that are not planned but rather arise from a simple set of rules. What can you see as the kinds of
          emergent behaviours arising from the simple interactions of harm and support that non-normative (pink) boids experience? What impact do many small harmful
          interactions have over time? What does harm and support from people and instititutions look like for people of <em>all</em> genders and sexualities?</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          The stories in the simulation have been collected from people with various gender and sexual identities, including cisgender and transgender, and queer (LGBQ+) and heterosexual people.

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p lang="en-us">
            Flocking QT Stories, is an interactive digital art installation that explores how computational simulations of emergent complex behaviours, combined with storytelling,
            might provide us with new ways to deepen our understanding of gender and sexuality-based marginalization and resilience through computer modeling and art.
            <p><br /></p>
            Flocking QT Stories is part of Dylan Paré’s dissertation in the Learning Sciences in the Werklund School of Education at the University of Calgary, Canada.
            It was initially developed during the <a href="https://www.m3lab.org" target="_blank">Mind, Matter and Media Lab</a>’s Paul D. Fleck artist residency in
            the Leighton Studios at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity in 2019.
            The simulation was designed by Dylan Paré, coded by Dylan Paré and John Craig, and received advisory support from Dr. Pratim Sengupta and Dr. Marie-Claire Shanahan
            of the Mind, Matter and Media Lab at the University of Calgary Werklund School of Education, Canada.
            It has exhibited at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, TELUS Spark Science Centre, and at DigiPlay, a public exhibit space at the University of Calgary
            Werklund School of Education.
