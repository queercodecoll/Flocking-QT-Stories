          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p lang="en-us">
            Flocking QT Stories, is an interactive digital art installation that explores how computational simulations of emergent complex behaviours, combined with storytelling,
            might provide us with new ways to deepen our understanding of gender and sexuality-based marginalization and resilience through computer modeling and art.
            The simulation models the emergent behaviour of societal gender and sexuality-based marginalization (harm) and resilience (support), showing how interactions between people,
            and between people and institutions have cumulative effects on an individual person. The stories in the simulation have been collected from people around Alberta with various
            gender and sexual identities, including cisgender and transgender, and queer (LGBQ+) and heterosexual people. </br>
            The simulation is part of Dylan Paré’s dissertation in the Learning Sciences in the Werklund School of Education at the University of Calgary.
            It was initially developed during the Mind, Matter and Media Lab’s Paul D. Fleck artist residency in the Leighton Studios at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity.
            The simulation was designed by Dylan Paré, coded by Dylan Paré and John Craig, and received advisory support from Dr. Pratim Sengupta and Dr. Marie-Claire Shanahan
            of the Mind, Matter and Media Lab at the University of Calgary Werklund School of Education, Canada.
            It has exhibited at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, TELUS Spark Science Centre, and at DigiPlay, a public exhibit space at the University of Calgary
            Werklund School of Education.
