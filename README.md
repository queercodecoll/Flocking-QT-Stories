Description
    Flocking QT Stories, is an interactive digital art installation that explores how computational simulations of emergent complex behaviours, combined with storytelling, might provide us with new ways to deepen our understanding of gender and sexuality-based marginalization and resilience through computer modeling and art.

    Flocking QT Stories models the emergent behaviour of societal gender and sexuality-based marginalization (harm) and resilience (support). Emergent behaviors are new behaviors (or patterns in a simulation) that are not planned but rather arise from a simple set of rules. What can you see as the kinds of emergent behaviours arising from the simple interactions of harm and support that non-normative (pink) boids experience? What impact do many small harmful interactions have over time? What does harm and support from people and instititutions look like for people of all genders and sexualities?

    The stories in the simulation have been collected from people with various gender and sexual identities, including cisgender and transgender, and queer (LGBQ+) and heterosexual people.

    Flocking QT Stories is part of Dylan Paré’s dissertation in the Learning Sciences in the Werklund School of Education at the University of Calgary, Canada. The simulation was initially developed during the Mind, Matter and Media Lab’s Paul D. Fleck artist residency in the Leighton Studios at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity in April 2019 using Processing 3.5.4. Then in May 2020, it was re-written in p5.js 1.0.0 for display on the internet using GitHub and GitHub Pages in order to share the simulation with a larger audience. The simulation has exhibited at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, TELUS Spark Science Centre, and at DigiPlay, a public exhibit space at the University of Calgary Werklund School of Education.

Rules of the Simulation
    In the simulation, there are four types of computational agents: normative and non-normative boids or bird-droids (a term coined by Craig Reynolds), and two types of institutions: normative and non-normative. Proximity to normative boids and institutions "drains" energy from the non-normative boids, and proximity to other non-normative boids and institutions increases their energy. Each non-normative boid "carries" and audio story - a first person account of gender and/or sexuality-based marginalization and resilience.

    All of the boids move according to Craig Reynolds' (1987) flocking algorithm. In Reynolds' algorithm, the rules obeyed by each boid are alignment, separation, and cohesion. Alignment means that a boid tends to turn so that it is moving in the same direction that nearby boids are moving. Separation means that a boid will turn to avoid another boid which gets too close. Cohesion means that a boid will move towards other nearby boids (unless another boid is too close).

    In addition to these forces that are always in play, when a non-normative boid's story is activated, all the non-normative boids' movements are also affected in part by the frequences of the audio file which is broadcasted to all non-normative boids in the simulation. Higher-frequency sounds affect the cohesive motion, lower-frequency sounds affect the separation, and medium-frequency sounds align their directions with neighbouring boids. The overall effect is that the movement pattern of the non-normative boids is visually distinct from the normative boids while a story is being played. The non-normative boids vibrate synchronously while also flocking.

    Flocking QT Stories was designed by Dylan Paré, coded by Dylan Paré and John Craig, and received advisory support from Dr. Pratim Sengupta and Dr. Marie-Claire Shanahan of the Mind, Matter and Media Lab at the University of Calgary Werklund School of Education, Canada.

    Thank you to the people who shared their personal stories with me for the purposes of this project. The code would not have nearly as much life nor impact were it not for these stories.
